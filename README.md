Intro
    My name is Nikita Mathur and I live in Santa Clara, California. My CS50 final project is an AI-powered travel planner that suggests a travel destination based on five different questions. The app is coded in python in a file called app.py and it includes a file called requirements.txt. The application uses OpenAI and LangChain to have a short conversation with the user about their travel preferences. Based on the five questions asked, it puts everything together into a clear, personalized travel itinerary.
How it works:
        When you open the app, you first enter your OpenAI API key. This allows the app to connect to OpenAI’s language model, which is essentially the “brain” behind the planner. Once you enter the key, the app starts a short conversation with you. Instead of showing you a long form, the AI asks you five questions, one at a time, to understand what kind of vacation you want. These questions aren’t written beforehand. As you interact with the app, each question is generated by OpenAI on the spot, based on your previous answers. This is run using LangChain in the app.py code, which helps structure the prompts and manage the conversation flow. After the fifth question, the AI uses all of your answers together and creates a single, complete vacation plan. It first explains why the destination fits your preferences. It might talk about the budget, time of year, and activities based on your answers. The budget may not be completely accurate as it does not factor in where you are traveling from. Therefore, it doesn’t take into account the flight/travel accommodations to the vacation spot.  Then, it lists a day-by-day itinerary suggesting what to visit in the country.

Why I chose this and the problem it solves:
    When we were close to the winter holidays, my friends didn’t know where they should go. This led me to create a travel planner. Instead of using a database to create the final destination, I chose to use Langchain’s OpenAI as it already has a ton of data and is constantly adjusting to the world. Many travel planning tools rely on long forms and fixed options, which can be overwhelming when users are unsure of what they want. This project is similar to a short conversation instead, allowing the user to clarify their preferences gradually by answering one question at a time. The goal is to make planning feel more natural and less demanding, similar to speaking with a travel agent rather than filling out a checklist.

App.py
    The app.py file contains both the user interface and the application logic. It first configures the Streamlit page and then prompts the user to enter their OpenAI API key, which is required to connect to OpenAI when running on Streamlit Cloud. Once the key is provided, the app initializes a ChatOpenAI model using LangChain, which is used for all AI-generated content.
    The app relies on Streamlit’s session_state to maintain the conversation across page reruns. This state tracks the current question number, the history of questions and answers, the active question being displayed, and the final travel plan. Using session state allows the app to behave like a continuous conversation even though Streamlit refreshes the script after each interaction. Without session_state, the app would contain a long form, and the questions would not be dynamic or different each time.
    There are three prompt templates that instructs the AI on what to do. The first one generates the first travel-planning question, the next generates follow-up questions using the conversation history, and the final prompt produces a complete vacation plan. When I first coded this, it gave multiple destinations, and the final output looked confusing. Then, I tweaked it so that the final destination prompt has strict instructions to only select one destination. This ensures the final output is clear and focused.
    As the user submits each answer, the app stores it, increments the question count, and asks the next question from the AI. After the fifth response, the app generates and displays the finalized travel itinerary. A dynamic key is used for the text input field so that previous answers do not appear in new questions, ensuring the interface is clean. The “Start Over” button allows the user to reset the session and begin again. That way, the user does not need to reload the page every time they make a mistake or when they want another trip suggestion.

Requirements.txt
    The requirements.txt file lists the dependencies needed to run the application. It includes Streamlit for the web interface, LangChain for prompt and conversation management, and langchain-openai to connect LangChain with OpenAI’s chat models. These packages ensure everything runs smoothly when running the app locally or on Streamlit Cloud.
